This summer of 2025, I work as a computational chemistry researcher in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Denison University, working toward characterization of new semiconductor materials using computational methods of quantum chemistry. 

As cool as it sounds, I'm not the best person to ask about quantum chemistry, quantum physics, or high performance computing systems, or whatever related topics you might think about. The reality is I'm just a bleary-eyed undergrad with a mantra of never stop learning. That's why I'm sharing my journal in studying quantum chemistry. I might update this journal once every several days, daily, or even several times a day, but I will try my best to keep it updated as frequently as possible for the sake of my own learning.

This journal would be useful for people with some general understanding of quantum chemistry. If you know what Hartree-Fock theory and molecular orbitals are, this journal is appropriate for you. In this journal, I intend to read/watch/try original research papers, perspectives, literature reviews, textbooks, code documentations, tutorial videos, etc. (you name it).

I keep a bibliography of what I already read, am currently reading, or will read [here](../quantum-chemistry-bib.html).

For a list of all my journal updates, see [this archive](../archives/quantum-chem-archive.html).
